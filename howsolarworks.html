			<h2>Solar Panels</h2>
				<p> 
					Solar panels are made of a special cell called photovoltaic, that’s why generating electricity with solar panels is also called PV. These cells convert the suns energy into electricity. Photovoltaic cells lay between two layers, these 2 layers feature materials such a silicone for example. Each layer has different electronic properties when hit by sunlight, which creates an electric field. This is a so called photoelectric effect, this effect creates electricity.

            <h2>Charge Controller</h2>
				<p> 
					A Charge Controller is a voltage regulator that keeps batteries from overcharging. It does this by regulating the voltage coming from the solar panels. It shuts down the circuit, halting or beginning power heading off to the electric storage device or batteries. If this doesn’t happen the batteries will overcharge and will be damaged. However you don’t always need a Charge Controller, for example you don’t need one for small maintenance.

        <article class="articlesolar3">
			<h2>Battery System</h2>
				<p> 
					Solar batteries store excess energy produced by solar panels for later use. Solar batteries can have their own integrated energy conversion or so called inverter, but this is not always the case. The higher the capacity the more energy it can store. With batteries you can store extra energy at your home location instead of sending it back to the grid. This is very useful for when your solar panels stop producing electricity, you can use your batteries instead.
				</p>
        </article>
        <article class="articlesolar4">
			<h2>DC power</h2>
				<p> 
					DC is the power from the sun, converted by solar panels. DC itself isn’t very useful since your home uses AC power instead of DC power. The electricity collected by solar panels will in most cases automatically be used to run your home. If you by any chance have a Solar Battery, any excess solar power will instead be stored here, for later use when the sun goes down. If you don’t have a battery or your batteries are full, the power will instead be exported towards the grid.
				</p>
        </article>
        <article class="articlesolar5">
			<h2>Inverter</h2>
				<p> 
					A PV inverter or Solar inverter, is a type of converter which converts the power from the sun (DC) into of a photovoltaic solar panel into useable AC power, AC can be fed back into an electrical grid, stored in batteries or it can be used in your home. All an inverter does is basically converting useless DC power into useful AC power, it is an essential unit, but has very little use besides that.
				</p>
        </article>
        <article class="articlesolar6">
			<h2>AC Power</h2>
				<p> 
					AC power which can be used as a source of electricity to power homes, store in batteries or to convert back to a grid. AC power is not generated by solar panels alone or just sunlight. To gain AC power you first need to collect DC power from solar panel which collect DC power from sunlight. Some solar panels have an automatic build in inverter and some don’t. You however always need an inverter to convert DC power into AC power.
